### Research Question
>What is the ideal place in the city to live as a driver of an electric car?
### Idea
I want to make a data visualization, using D3, to show the reader how 'ideal' the life is of an electric car driver who lives in the city while still having to charge his / her car

## Data  
I think I can use [this data](https://github.com/ralfz123/functional-programming/wiki/Onderzoek-%F0%9F%94%8D#data) for my subject.
The data variables I think I can use, are:
- `AreaId` - [this](https://opendata.rdw.nl/Parkeren/Open-Data-Parkeren-GEBIED/adw6-9hsg) or [this](https://opendata.rdw.nl/Parkeren/Open-Data-Parkeren-GEOMETRIE-GEBIED/nsk3-v9n7)
- `GeoDataAsText` - [Dataset](https://opendata.rdw.nl/Parkeren/Open-Data-Parkeren-GEOMETRIE-GEBIED/nsk3-v9n7)
- `ChargingPointCapacity` - [Dataset](https://opendata.rdw.nl/Parkeren/Open-Data-Parkeren-SPECIFICATIES-PARKEERGEBIED/b3us-f26s)

### Dataset structure
```
